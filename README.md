### Description
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis

### Steps to generate the Tidy data set 
1. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
4. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject and name it "run_analysis.R".

### Usage
1. Download "run_analysis.R" and data folder resides in the same directory to your local folder 
2. Set work directory to that local folder and run the script  
3. A file named "run_analysis.R" will be generated.
